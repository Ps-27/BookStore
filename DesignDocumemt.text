Make sure it's safe and secure, only letting in authorized users.

Database (MySQL):

Use MySQL to store information about books, users, and their actions (like searches and purchases).
Connect the website and server to this database.

Deployment:

guides creation and explanations for users and developers.

Scalability:

according to this section, have to Make sure the system can handle more users and data as it grows.



recommendation algorithm based on user search history for books, you can follow these steps:

Data Model: Create a table in your MySQL database to store user search history. The table might have columns like user_id, search_term, timestamp, and other relevant information.

Data Collection: Whenever a registered user searches for a book, record their search terms in the database along with their user_id. For guest/visiting users, you can use their IP address as a unique identifier

Recommendation Algorithm: To recommend books to a user based on their search history, you can use a simple content-based filtering approach. Here's a basic algorithm:

When a user searches for a book, retrieve the search terms used by that user.
Look for other users who have used similar search terms.
Recommend books that were searched for by those users but not searched for by the current user.
Database Query: Write a SQL query to fetch recommended books based on the user's search history and similar searches by other users.

Database Query: Write a SQL query to fetch recommended books based on the user's search history and similar searches by other users.


getRecommendations function fetches books that were searched by users with similar search terms but not searched by the current user. The getUserSearchHistory function retrieves the search history of the current user based on their user ID.

Please make sure you have a user_search_history table in your MySQL database to store user search history, including user_id, search_term, and timestamp. Additionally, you should adapt this code to handle guest/visiting users based on their IP address as needed

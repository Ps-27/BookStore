# Online Book-Store 

What the Project Does:
creating a website where people can:

See and search for books.
Sign up and log in.
Put books they want to buy in a virtual cart.
Look at their past orders if they're signed in.

How It Works:

There will be a part of the website that people see and use (like a bookshop).
There's another part hidden away (like a storeroom) that stores book and user information.
We'll connect these two parts so they work together.
We'll make sure it's safe from bad things happening, like people trying to break in.

Extra Things:

We'll also keep track of what people do on the website (like what books they look at).
Based on that, we'll suggest other books they might like.
Everything will be tested to make sure it works correctly.
We'll write guides for people to understand how to use it.
It can grow bigger if lots of people use it.
